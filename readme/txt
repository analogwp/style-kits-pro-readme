All your custom page styles can be saved as a Stylekit and then apply it on any page.

You can also make a Global Style Kit, and it will apply on your entire site.

#### Button Styles

#### A collection of fine-tuned, Style-kit powered templates. Free & Premium.

In most of the templates, styles are managed from the Style Kit panel, so you can experience design-macro control right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do the templates require Elementor Pro? =
No, you do not need Elementor Pro at this point. All the templates that are provided for free are only using the Contact Form widget (which is an Elementor Pro feature). But you can always replace with your favorite contact form plugin.

= What fonts are you using in designs? =
All font pairs in our templates are Google web fonts, we love typography and are always in the look-out for great font combinations.

= Can I use the templates for client projects as well? =
Yes, you can. You can use the templates in any number of personal or client projects. However you cannot re-distribute the templates without our prior consent. You can view the full terms and template licensing here: https://analogwp.com/terms-of-use/.

= What are Style Kits? =
Style Kits (since v1.2) is a collection of the custom Typography and Spacing styles that you have added to your templates, which can be reused with other templates, making the process of creating new templates a lot easier.

= How frequently do you add new designs? =
We try to follow a consistent release cycle of two templates per week.

Definitely, given that you have Elementor in your theme setup, the templates will get imported and work just fine.
